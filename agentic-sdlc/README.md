# Agentic SDLC

## What is this?

This directory contains the **Agentic Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** structure for managing project workflows, backlogs, and collaboration between humans and AI agents.

## What's in here?

```
agentic-sdlc/
├── README.md              # This file - overview of Agentic SDLC structure
├── AWP.md                 # Agentic Workflow Protocol - workflow and procedures
├── commitStandard.md      # Commit message standards and conventions
└── backlogs/              # All project backlogs organized by feature
    └── {feature-name}/    # Each feature has its own backlog folder
        ├── project-backlog.md
        └── tasks/
            ├── planned/
            └── unplanned/
```

## How to work with it?

1. **Read `AWP.md`** - Contains all workflow procedures, protocols, and how to work with backlogs
2. **Navigate to backlogs** - Each feature has its own folder in `backlogs/{feature-name}/`
3. **Follow the structure** - `project-backlog.md` → `tasks/planned/` → individual task files

For detailed procedures, workflow steps, and backlog structure details, see `AWP.md`.
