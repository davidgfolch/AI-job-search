## System Classification

### Why This System is High-Risk

The system falls under **Annex III, Section 4(b)** - "AI systems intended to be used for recruitment or selection of natural persons" as it:

1. **Automates CV Matching:** Uses AI agents (CrewAI) to match CVs against job requirements and calculate compatibility percentages
2. **Influences Employment Decisions:** The CV match percentage directly influences which jobs users consider applying for
3. **Processes Employment Data:** Handles personal CV data, job application history, and employment preferences
4. **Makes Recommendations:** AI-enriched data (salary estimates, skills extraction) guides user decisions

### System Components Analyzed:

1. **AI Enrichment Module** (`apps/aiEnrich/`)
   - Uses CrewAI agents with LLMs (Ollama/OpenAI)
   - Extracts salary estimates, required technologies, and skills from job postings
   - Processes job descriptions using natural language processing

2. **CV Matching Module** (`apps/aiEnrich/src/aiEnrich/cvMatcher.py`)
   - Compares user CVs against job requirements
   - Calculates match percentages (0-100) based on:
     - Required skills match (40% weight)
     - Experience level (25% weight)
     - Optional skills (15% weight)
     - Education/certifications (10% weight)
     - Industry knowledge (10% weight)
   - Stores match percentages in database

3. **Job Scraping & Management**
   - Aggregates job listings from multiple platforms
   - Tracks application status and user preferences
   - Manages employment-related personal data

## Code Violation Patterns Detected

Based on AI Act violation pattern analysis, the following patterns were identified:

### Pattern 1: Automated Decision Without Human Oversight
**Location:** `apps/aiEnrich/src/aiEnrich/cvMatcher.py:76-80`

**Issue:** CV matching decisions are made automatically without human review mechanism.

**Fix Required:**
```python
# Add human review for high-stakes decisions
if requires_human_review(decision):
    decision = await human_reviewer.review(decision)
```

### Pattern 2: Data Processing Without Governance
**Location:** Multiple locations in `apps/aiEnrich/`

**Issue:** Data processing lacks governance measures.

**Fix Required:**
```python
# Ensure data quality, relevance, and representativeness
validate_data_quality(data)
ensure_data_relevance(data)
check_data_representativeness(data)
```

### Pattern 3: Missing Transparency Information
**Location:** Frontend UI components

**Issue:** AI system deployment without transparency information.

**Fix Required:**
```python
# Provide transparency information
provide_transparency_information({
    'intended_purpose': 'CV matching and job enrichment',
    'accuracy_metrics': '...',
    'limitations': '...'
})
```
