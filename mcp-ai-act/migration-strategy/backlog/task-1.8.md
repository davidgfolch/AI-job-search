# Task ID: 1.8
# Title: Document CV Matching Algorithm
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: critical
# Owner: Technical Documentation Team
# Estimated Effort: 6h

## Description
Document the CV matching algorithm including weight breakdown (skills 40%, experience 25%, optional skills 15%, education 10%, industry knowledge 10%), input/output specifications, and limitations. This task addresses EU AI Act Article 11 - Technical Documentation requirements.

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task ID: 1

## Testing Instructions
1. Verify algorithm description is complete
2. Verify weight breakdown is accurate (40%, 25%, 15%, 10%, 10%)
3. Verify input/output specifications are documented
4. Verify limitations are clearly stated
5. Review documentation for clarity and accuracy

## Security Review
- Ensure documentation doesn't expose proprietary algorithm details unnecessarily
- Verify no sensitive user data examples in documentation

## Risk Assessment
- Missing algorithm documentation violates EU AI Act Article 11
- Incomplete documentation makes compliance assessment difficult
- Non-compliance could result in regulatory fines

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Algorithm description complete
- [ ] Weight breakdown explained correctly:
  - Required skills match (40% weight)
  - Experience level (25% weight)
  - Optional skills (15% weight)
  - Education/certifications (10% weight)
  - Industry knowledge (10% weight)
- [ ] Input/output specifications documented
- [ ] Limitations documented
- [ ] Documentation is clear and accessible

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CV_MATCHING_ALGORITHM.md created
- [ ] Algorithm description complete
- [ ] Weight breakdown documented with percentages
- [ ] Input specifications documented
- [ ] Output specifications documented
- [ ] Limitations clearly stated
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met

## Measurable Outcomes
- **Verification Criteria**: Documentation file exists, algorithm described, weights documented, I/O specs present, limitations stated, review approved
- **Observable Outcomes**: Complete algorithm documentation available, clear and accessible
- **Quality Attributes**: Comprehensive, accurate, well-organized documentation
- **Completion Indicators**: CV_MATCHING_ALGORITHM.md created, all information present, review completed

## Notes
This documentation should be technical but accessible. Consider including examples or diagrams to illustrate the algorithm. Keep documentation updated if algorithm changes.

## Strengths
Required for EU AI Act Article 11 compliance. Essential for transparency and user understanding. Critical for conformity assessment.
