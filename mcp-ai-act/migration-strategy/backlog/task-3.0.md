## Description
Epic 3: Advanced Compliance (Month 2-3) - This epic focuses on implementing advanced EU AI Act compliance requirements including comprehensive logging and audit trails, accuracy monitoring and metrics, cybersecurity enhancements, and robustness testing. This epic addresses Articles 12 and 15 of the EU AI Act (enhanced requirements).

This epic is broken down into 8 child tasks covering:
- Article 12: Record Keeping Enhanced (Tasks 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)
- Article 15: Accuracy and Robustness (Tasks 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task ID: 2.0 (Epic 2 must be completed first)
- [ ] Task ID: 1.4 (Logging Infrastructure)
- [ ] Task ID: 1.5 (Basic AI Operation Logging)

## Testing Instructions
Verify that all child tasks are completed and meet their acceptance criteria. Epic is complete when all 8 child tasks are done.

## Security Review
Each child task includes security review requirements. Overall epic security: ensure audit trails are secure, cybersecurity measures are effective, endpoints are hardened.

## Risk Assessment
- Delays in this epic block Epic 4 (Conformity Assessment)
- Missing any child task violates EU AI Act requirements
- Non-compliance could result in fines up to €35 million or 7% of annual turnover

## Acceptance Criteria
