# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: high
# Owner: Dev Team
# Estimated Effort: 38h (sum of child tasks)

## Description
Epic 1: Immediate Actions (Week 1-2) - This epic focuses on critical EU AI Act compliance requirements that must be implemented immediately. It includes adding AI transparency notices to UI, implementing basic logging for AI operations, and documenting system architecture and AI components. This epic addresses Articles 11, 12, and 13 of the EU AI Act.

This epic is broken down into 8 child tasks covering:
- Article 13: Transparency Information (Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
- Article 12: Record Keeping (Tasks 1.4, 1.5)
- Article 11: Technical Documentation (Tasks 1.6, 1.7, 1.8)

## Dependencies
- None (this is the first epic)

## Testing Instructions
Verify that all child tasks are completed and meet their acceptance criteria. Epic is complete when all 8 child tasks are done.

## Security Review
Each child task includes security review requirements. Overall epic security: ensure no PII in logs, verify transparency notices don't expose sensitive information.

## Risk Assessment
- Delays in this epic block all subsequent epics
- Missing any child task violates EU AI Act requirements
- Non-compliance could result in fines up to €35 million or 7% of annual turnover

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 8 child tasks completed (1.1 through 1.8)
- [ ] All child tasks meet their acceptance criteria
- [ ] Epic deliverables reviewed and approved
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Epic 2

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Task 1.1: AI Transparency Notice completed
- [ ] Task 1.2: CV Match Score Explanation completed
- [ ] Task 1.3: "Powered by AI" Labels completed
- [ ] Task 1.4: Basic AI Operation Logging completed
- [ ] Task 1.5: Logging Infrastructure completed
- [ ] Task 1.6: System Architecture Documentation completed
- [ ] Task 1.7: AI Model Specifications Documentation completed
- [ ] Task 1.8: CV Matching Algorithm Documentation completed
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Epic review completed

## Measurable Outcomes
- **Verification Criteria**: All 8 child tasks completed, all acceptance criteria met
- **Observable Outcomes**: Transparency notices visible, logging functional, documentation complete
- **Quality Attributes**: EU AI Act Articles 11, 12, 13 compliance achieved
- **Completion Indicators**: All child tasks marked complete, epic review passed

## Notes
Epic 1 of 4. This is the foundation epic for EU AI Act compliance. All tasks are critical and must be completed before moving to Epic 2.

## Strengths
Essential foundation for EU AI Act compliance. Addresses critical transparency, logging, and documentation requirements. Enables subsequent compliance epics.
