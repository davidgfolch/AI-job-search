# Task ID: 1.6
# Title: Document System Architecture
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: critical
# Owner: Technical Documentation Team
# Estimated Effort: 8h

## Description
Create comprehensive system architecture documentation including architecture diagrams, component descriptions, data flow diagrams, and AI system integration points. This task addresses EU AI Act Article 11 - Technical Documentation requirements.

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task ID: 1

## Testing Instructions
1. Verify all components are documented
2. Verify architecture diagrams are accurate
3. Verify data flow diagrams are complete
4. Verify AI system integration points are documented
5. Review documentation for clarity and completeness
6. Verify documentation is accessible and well-organized

## Security Review
- Ensure documentation doesn't expose sensitive system details
- Verify no credentials or secrets in documentation
- Review for information disclosure risks

## Risk Assessment
- Missing documentation violates EU AI Act Article 11
- Incomplete documentation makes compliance assessment difficult
- Poor documentation affects maintainability
- Non-compliance could result in regulatory fines

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Architecture diagrams created
- [ ] Component descriptions documented
- [ ] Data flow diagrams created
- [ ] AI system integration points documented
- [ ] Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation is accessible (markdown format)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md created
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md created
- [ ] Architecture diagrams included
- [ ] Component descriptions complete
- [ ] Data flow diagrams included
- [ ] AI integration points documented
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met

## Measurable Outcomes
- **Verification Criteria**: Documentation files exist, diagrams present, all components documented, review approved
- **Observable Outcomes**: Complete architecture documentation available, diagrams clear and accurate
- **Quality Attributes**: Comprehensive, clear, well-organized documentation
- **Completion Indicators**: Documentation files created, diagrams included, review completed

## Notes
Use standard diagramming tools (Mermaid, PlantUML, or similar). Keep diagrams up-to-date as system evolves. Consider version control for diagrams.

## Strengths
Essential for EU AI Act Article 11 compliance. Helps with system understanding and maintenance. Required for conformity assessment.
